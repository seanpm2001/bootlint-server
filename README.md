Run [Bootlint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint-server) as a server.

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install bootlint-server`

## What's this

Bootlint can also be run as an HTTP server that exposes a very simple API. Use `npm run start` to run the server.

By default, it runs on port `7070`. Set the `$PORT` environment variable to change which port it uses.

POST an HTML document to `/` and the document's lint problems will be returned as JSON.

The endpoint accepts an optional querystring argument named `disable`, whose value is a comma-separated list of linter IDs to disable.

Example:

```http
Request:
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: text/html

  <!doctype html>
  ...

Response:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  [
    {
      "id": "W003",
      "message": "<head> is missing viewport <meta> tag that enables responsiveness"
    },
    {
      "id": "W005",
      "message": "Unable to locate jQuery, which is required for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins to work"
    },
    ...
  ]
```
